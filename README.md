# Terraform -- Build Multi-Tier Infrastructure

## üöÄ Overview

Using Provisioner uses `terraform` to create a multi-tier infrastructure build on `AWS Cloud`. The `terraform` job expects variables set as environment variables or in a terraform.tfvars file.

NOTE: Terraform must be version 0.12 or greater.


## üéØ Getting Started

As new guides cross my path to assist in my knowledge and understanding of how the AWS Provider works and the best practices to build infrastructure using Terraform. I will update this repository as new tutorials become available for me to learn and use to gain more knowledge. The ***Guides*** portion of this README will be updated accordingly with links used to learn. This is done for future referencing and of course to give credit to the original owner.

## üí° Project Idea:
**Automate Multi-Tier AWS Infrastructure**

## üì¶ Objective
**Objective**: Create a multi-tier AWS infrastructure with Terraform, comprising a ***VPC***, ***public*** and ***private*** ***subnets***, an ***EC2 instance*** in the **private subnet**, an ***Application Load Balancer (ALB)*** in the **public subnet**, and a ***relational database (Amazon RDS)*** in the **private subnet**.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Terraform Enviroment Workspace
```bash
    terraform workspace list
    terraform workspace new <workspace-name>
    terraform select <workspace-name>
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Connection

### SSH Commands:
#### Generate SSH Key Pair:
```bash
$ ssh-keygen
```

#### EC2 Connect
```bash
$ chmod 400 <'nameOfKeyPair'>.pem
$ ssh -i "<'nameOfKeyPair'>.pem" <'user-name'>@<'instance-public-domain'>
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Deployment

Run the following to ensure ***terraform*** will only perform the expected
actions:

```bash
terraform fmt
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Tearing Down the Terraform Infrastructure

Run the following to verify that ***terraform*** will only impact the expected
nodes and then tear down the cluster.

```sh
terraform plan
terraform destroy
```
